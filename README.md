The Brisbane 2032 Gold Pass is a new web application looking to revolutionise the ticketing experience in the leadup to the 2032 Brisbane Olympic Games. The application sets itself apart from other ticketing services by creating an emotional buildup to an event, generating excitement and anticipation with a range of new features. Some examples include a countdown to event commencement when viewing your ticket.

And a 3D VR view of the stadium from your allocated seat, as well as a supporters map that highlights which sections of the stadium different countries supporters will be seated in

The site currently includes an animated landing / welcome page, functional account login and management, an event page with listed olympic events that link to pages for ticket purchase and stadium seating viewing, and pages for each olympic venue with images of the venue and directions.
