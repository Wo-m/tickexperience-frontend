The Brisbane 2032 Gold Pass is a new web application looking to revolutionise the ticketing experience in the leadup to the 2032 Brisbane Olympic Games. The application sets itself apart from other ticketing services by creating an emotional buildup to an event, generating excitement and anticipation with a range of new features. 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.6.
